# ChemInformatics-Machine-Learning-with-NNScore-2.0

**Note: As of January 2018, this is still an ongoing project.** New software is being written using the pseudocode/basic abstraction which will ultimately yield new molecular descriptors that can be used for ML. 

**Introduction**

Novel research idea in the Dr. Jacob D. Durrant Lab of Computational Drug Discovery at the University of Pittsburgh ([Lab Page](https://durrantlab.pitt.edu/)) that wanted to find new ways of extracting potentially significant features/descriptors of molecules by reutilizing and modifying code from NNScore 2.0. NNScore 2.0 is a neural network-based ligand-protein interaction prediction software that takes into account the many available descriptors/features of a Protein Data Bank (PDB) file to ultimately rank many possible ligands against a protein. This open-source software can be downloaded at [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nnscore/files/NNScore%202.01/). The academic paper that describes the software in depth can be found [here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci2003889). 

**Documents in Folder**

`ML_Features_NNScore2.0_Basic_Abstraction.txt`

Contains basic structure of the code in a language agnostic manner while including all the different variables required. This is mainly surface-level detail abstraction of the necessary code to extract potentially meaningful molecular features. 

`NNSCore2.0_Descriptors_Pseudocode.txt`

Well-organized and final pseudocode document that lays out the actual analysis and reasons behind the code and the way/order in which it is executed. It gives clear explanation/instruction on what needs to be done at each point in such a way that the pseudocode can be taken and modified heavily to yield the same result as the original software.
