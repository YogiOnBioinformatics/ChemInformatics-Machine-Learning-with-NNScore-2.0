# ChemInformatics-Machine-Learning-with-NNScore-2.0

Novel research idea in the Dr. Jacob D. Durrant Lab of Computational Drug Discovery at the University of Pittsburgh ([Lab Page](https://durrantlab.pitt.edu/)) that wanted to find new ways of extracting potentially significant features/descriptors of molecules by reutilizing and modifying code from NNScore 2.0. NNScore 2.0 is a neural network-based ligand-protein interaction prediction software that takes into account the many available descriptors/features of a Protein Data Bank (PDB) file to ultimately rank many possible ligands against a protein. This open-source software can be downloaded at [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nnscore/files/NNScore%202.01/). The academic paper that describes the software in depth can be found [here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci2003889).
