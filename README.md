# ChemInformatics-Machine-Learning-with-NNScore-2.0

Novel research idea in the Dr. Jacob D. Durrant Lab of Computational Drug Discovery at the University of Pittsburgh that wanted to find new ways of extracting potentially significant features/descriptors of molecules by reutilizing and modifying code from NNScore 2.0. NNScore 2.0 is a neural network-based ligand-protein interaction prediction software that takes into account the many available descriptors/features of a Protein Data Bank (PDB) file to ultimately rank many possible ligands against a protein.
